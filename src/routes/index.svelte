			Bridging Seas is a youth-led global organization that aims to unify the Asian diaspora. Our goal is to connect high schoolers from around the world by creating a platform for them to learn about each other's cultures and unique experiences. We envision a more compassionate, understanding world where students embrace their roots and different lifestyles through direct communication with international friends.

			Bridging Seas believes culture represents a vision of life that follows us from our upbringings to our futures and aspirations. Culture is the core of who we are and connects us with those who share the same culture. Recognizing the potential for culture to unify the Asian diaspora, Bridging Seas aims to emphasize the discussion of culture with all youth, connecting students from around the world closer to their cultural roots and encouraging them to embrace the diversity of culture around them through pen palling

			As youth ourselves, the Bridging Seas team knows too well the constant struggle to love 
			and appreciate our nuanced and diverse cultures. Bridging Seas is a safe platform for students to not only appreciate 
			 their cultural roots through exchange with students that share those roots, but also a place to discover 
			 how their culture is diverse, adaptable, and changing all the time when they speak with students that even though share the same ethnicity as them, 
			 live in different parts of the world and experience culture in a completely different way.

			Bridging Seaâ€™s foremost mission is to create safe spaces for our students to feel comfortable sharing their culture with others. Learning to appreciate our culture can be a hard struggle. We aim to make our students feel supported and heard in our community as they grow in their cultural exploration. Through our monthly meetings and community corners, we cultivate that safe space for our youth to come together and make friends that will become a part of their family.
