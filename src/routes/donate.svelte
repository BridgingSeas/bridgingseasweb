            Donations will go towards purchases to help us continue operations. This includes: <br>
            •  maintaining our website <br>
            •  applying for 501(c)(3) nonprofit status <br>
            •  promotions to spread our mission <br>
            <br>

            As a relatively new organization, we depend on your donations to continue helping connect the Asian diaspora. All extra funds will be donated to organizations or projects that help AAPI combat hate or assist other Asian countries to recover from COVID. Each donor can vote for which organization and project they’d like us to support. Additionally, the top 20 donors can choose to have their name displayed on our website as a token of our appreciation.
